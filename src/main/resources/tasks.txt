1. Implement search functionality
	1.5. Implement FE for search, consider live search using jQuery autocomplete

3. Tags can be removed

6. Make logging to a file

7. Maybe set hibernate logging properly

8. Create users and authorization/authentication

9. Protect REST (or check if it is needed)

10. Use Cookies or similar to pre-fill some data in the sayings form

11. Fix database - review constraints, associations, table names...

12. Maybe externalize sql queries?

13. Consider changing searching mechanism to utilize all search types without checking some radio button first.
For example like on facebook, when you type something it searches for names, locations, groups and more at the
same time.

14. Consider hot-reload

16. Make admin page and permit it only for admins. For example configuration can be reloaded there without restarting the app

18. For post_cooldown.format.units=minutes,seconds, when there is < 1sec left, no time is displayed
==========================RESOLVED TASKS============================

2. Fix layout glitches

1.1. Search all sayings that have one of the specified tags
1.2. Search all sayings that have exactly specified tags
1.3. Search all sayings from specified author
1.4. Search all sayings by text

4. Forbid empty sayings to be posted

5. Display cooldown time in some unit other then ms

17. (Duplicate of 15.) Search doesn't work:
public List<Integer> getSayingsContainingExactlyGivenTags(@Param(value="tagIds")String tagIds, @Param(value="tagCount") String tagCount)

15. Query getSayingsContainingExactlyGivenTags in SayingRepository don't work for searching one tag (tested with 33)
