1. Implement search functionality
	1.6. Defining event listener inside success branch from json call don't work, fix it

7. Maybe set hibernate logging properly

8. Create users and authorization/authentication

9. Protect REST (or check if it is needed)

10. Use Cookies or similar to pre-fill some data in the sayings form

11. Fix database - review constraints, associations, table names... (saying's author should be foreign key to User)

12. Maybe externalize sql queries?

13. Consider changing searching mechanism to utilize all search types without checking some radio button first.
For example like on facebook, when you type something it searches for names, locations, groups and more at the
same time.

14. Consider hot-reload

16. Make admin page and permit it only for admins. For example configuration can be reloaded there without restarting the app

18. For post_cooldown.format.units=minutes,seconds, when there is < 1sec left, no time is displayed

19. Autocomplete search - implement that json call result is discarded and new call is initiated when result.searchTerm is different then 
data currently in the search box inserted by user (if needed at all, for now this seems to work pretty well)

20. Think about removing jquery autocomplete and making custom autocomplete more reusable and replacing jquery's ac

21. Move backend searching logic to some other controller. Currently it is implemented in test controller.

22. DBSearcher currently don't use third parameter List<SearchType>, find usage for it or discard it

23. Make some kind of a CMS for the most important parts of the app, so it can be easily changed

24. Make a template for displaying a saying (templates/sayingTemplate.html)

==========================RESOLVED TASKS============================

2. Fix layout glitches

1.1. Search all sayings that have one of the specified tags
1.2. Search all sayings that have exactly specified tags
1.3. Search all sayings from specified author
1.4. Search all sayings by text
1.5. Implement FE for search, consider live search using jQuery autocomplete

4. Forbid empty sayings to be posted

5. Display cooldown time in some unit other then ms

17. (Duplicate of 15.) Search doesn't work:
public List<Integer> getSayingsContainingExactlyGivenTags(@Param(value="tagIds")String tagIds, @Param(value="tagCount") String tagCount)

15. Query getSayingsContainingExactlyGivenTags in SayingRepository don't work for searching one tag (tested with 33)

3. Tags can be removed

6. Make logging to a file
